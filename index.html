       <p> The Xbox is a gaming colsole. It was first put into thought in
   1998, with Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Otto Berkes, and Ted Hase
   forming the software giant’s first console team after
   successfully pitching their idea to Bill Gates.
   The system would run on Windows 2000, making it easy for traditional PC software
   developers to work within the console’s architecture,
   and feature more than twice the processing power of the industry-leading
   PlayStation 2. Just two years later, Microsoft was ready to go public with its
   console, and that’s exactly what Bill Gates did at the Game Developers
   Conference in 2000 .On November 14, the Times Square branch of Toys ‘R’ Us
   played host to the official launch of the Xbox, with Bill Gates dropping by
   to kick off his company’s grand experiment in gaming. Concerns regarding the
   system’s look and design, as well as the $299 price tag, fell by the wayside
   with over 1 million Xbox consoles flying off shelves in the next three weeks.
   Xbox release dates in Japan (February 22, 2002) and Europe (March 14, 2002)
   soon followed, though the system failed to catch fire in either of the two
   regions with the same energy that fueled its arrival in North America.
   In Japan, only 123,000 Xbox units sold in the first week of release,
   validating Microsoft’s fear that the system would have a tough time breaking
   into the notoriously difficult overseas marketplace. With Xbox's global market,
   1.2 trillion jobs were made over 2 continent, and 3 countires. if </p>

         <p>Who created the telephone?</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Alexander Graham Bell</li>
           <li>Bell was born on March 3, 1847 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Alexander
           Graham Bell is best known for his invention of the telephone, for
           which he received his first patent in 1876. Despite the hundreds of
           lawsuits that would challenge his claim to the invention, none
           would prove successful. Born in Scotland and later becoming a U.S.
           citizen, Bell spent his life in pursuit of scientific discovery,
            and despite his myriad accomplishments as a scientist and
            inventor, he saw himself first and foremost as a teacher of the
            deaf, dedicating the majority of his work to that field.</li>
