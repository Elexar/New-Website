         <p>Who created the Xbox?</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Bill Gates</li>
           <li> <strong>1.5 million</strong> copies</li>

       <p> The Xbox is a gaming colsole. It was first put into thought in
   1998, with Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Otto Berkes, and Ted Hase
   forming the software giant’s first console team after
   successfully pitching their idea to Bill Gates.
   The system would run on Windows 2000, making it easy for traditional PC software
   developers to work within the console’s architecture,
   and feature more than twice the processing power of the industry-leading
   PlayStation 2. Just two years later, Microsoft was ready to go public with its
   console, and that’s exactly what Bill Gates did at the Game Developers
   Conference in 2000 .On November 14, the Times Square branch of Toys ‘R’ Us
   played host to the official launch of the Xbox, with Bill Gates dropping by
   to kick off his company’s grand experiment in gaming. Concerns regarding the
   system’s look and design, as well as the $299 price tag, fell by the wayside
   with over 1 million Xbox consoles flying off shelves in the next three weeks.
   Xbox release dates in Japan (February 22, 2002) and Europe (March 14, 2002)
   soon followed, though the system failed to catch fire in either of the two
   regions with the same energy that fueled its arrival in North America.
   In Japan, only 123,000 Xbox units sold in the first week of release,
   validating Microsoft’s fear that the system would have a tough time breaking
   into the notoriously difficult overseas marketplace. With Xbox's global market,
   1.2 trillion jobs were made over 2 continent, and 3 countires. if </p>

         <p>Who created the telephone?</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Alexander Graham Bell</li>
           <li>March 3, 1847</li>
           <li>November 12, 2005</li>
       <p>The Telephone is a intercommunication device used to contact others
nation/world wide.Bell was born on March 3, 1847 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Alexander Graham Bell is best known for his invention of the telephone, for
which he received his first patent in 1876. Despite the hundreds of
lawsuits that would challenge his claim to the invention, none
would prove successful. Born in Scotland and later becoming a U.S.
citizen, Bell spent his life in pursuit of scientific discovery,
and despite his myriad accomplishments as a scientist and
inventor, he saw himself first and foremost as a teacher of the
deaf, dedicating the majority of his work to that field. While not
the best student, Bell had an uncanny talent for problem solving.
At 12 years old, he invented a farming device for his friend’s father
that quickly andefficiently removed the husks from wheat grain.
After being homeschooled and attending private school for a year, Bell went on
to the Royal High School at Edinburgh but eventually dropped out because he
didn’t enjoy the mandatory curriculum.
Although Bell had a tense relationship with his own father, he was heavily
influenced by him and his grandfather, both of whom devoted their careers to
voice mechanics and elocution. Bell followed in their footsteps and became a
teacher for the deaf. While a teacher for the hearing impaired, Bell was asked
by a group of investors — one of whom was his father-in-law Gardiner Hubbard —
 to help perfect the harmonic telegraph. The device was one of the most exciting
innovations of the day, allowing for multiple messages to be sent over wire
simultaneously. But Bell was more keen on developing a voice transmitting
device, which he would later call the telephone. After some negotiation, the
investors allowed for Bell to work on both technologies, with more focus on the
popular harmonic telegraph. However, in the end, the telephone won out.
As Bell would later explain, “If I could make a current of electricity vary in
intensity precisely as the air varies in density during the production of sound,
I should be able to transmit speech telegraphically.”
On March 7, 1876, Bell was awarded a patent on the device, and three days
later, he made his first successful telephone call to his assistant,
electrician Thomas Watson, who would hear Bell’s famous words transmitted
through the wire: “Mr. Watson, come here. I want you.”</p>
